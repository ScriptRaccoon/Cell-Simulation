# Cell Simulation

Demo: https://cell-simulation.netlify.app/

This is a simulation of cells who are looking for food. They are attracted to this food and move smoothly towards it using a steering and a swimming motion, almost like fish. Once the food is eaten by a cell, the cell grows, a new cell is born at that point, and new food appears elsewhere.
